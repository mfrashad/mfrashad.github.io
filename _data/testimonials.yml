  position: Engineering Lead, Fave
  text: Rashad worked as a software developer intern in my team in Fave . His responsibilities were requirements gathering, analysis, design of features, fixing bugs and improving some parts of our codebase. During the course of his internship, he proved himself to be a fast learner. I was always impressed by his pull request descriptions. I found it very clear and it gave me enough context to understand what he was working on. He solves problems on his own and asks for feedback on how he can improve his skills in software development. With the right guidance, I'm pretty sure that he is going to be successful as a software developer.
